## Problem Statement
- Build a browser-based Tic Tac Toe application with an Angular frontend and a .NET backend running locally.
- The application should allow users to play Tic Tac Toe, track moves, undo moves, maintain a scoreboard, and support a basic computer opponent mode.

The solution should be easy for the panel to run, review, and discuss.

## Technology Expectations
Use the following stack:
  - **Frontend:** Angular + TypeScript
  - **Backend:** .NET Web API
  - **API Style:** REST API
  - **Storage:** In-memory storage is acceptable; SQLite may be used if preferred
  - **Source Control:** GitHub
The Angular application should communicate with the .NET backend through REST APIs.
The backend should manage the game session and scoreboard state.

## Functional Requirements
### 1. Game Board
- Create a standard **3 × 3 Tic Tac Toe board**.
  - Each cell should be clickable when it is empty.
  - Once a move is made, the selected cell should display either **X** or **O**.
  - A selected cell should remain locked for the rest of the current game state.

### 2. Player Turns
- The game should support two players:
- Player X
- Player O
- The application should clearly display whose turn it is.
- Players should alternate turns after every valid move.
- Invalid moves should not change the current turn.

### 3. Win Detection
- The application should detect a winner when a player completes:
- One full row
- One full column
- One diagonal
- When a player wins, the application should:
- Show the winning player
- Highlight the winning cells
- Prevent additional moves for the completed game
- Update the scoreboard

### 4. Draw Detection
- If all 9 cells are filled and there is no winner, the game should be marked as a draw.
- When the game is drawn, the application should:
- Show a draw message
- Prevent additional moves for the completed game
- Update the scoreboard

### 5. Reset Game
- Provide a **Reset Game** option. Reset Game should:
- Clear the current board
- Clear the move history
- Clear winner or draw status
- Set the current player back to X
- Start a fresh game session
- Keep the scoreboard unchanged

## Must-Have
### 1. Move History
- The application should display move history for the current game.
- For each move, show:
- Move number
- Player
- Cell position
- Example:
| **Move** | **Player** | **Position** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | X | Row 1, Column 1 |
| 2 | O | Row 2, Column 2 |
- The move history should update after every valid move.

### 2. Undo Last Move
- Provide an **Undo Last Move** option.
- Undo should restore the game to the previous valid state.
- Undo should:
- Remove the latest move or move pair based on the selected game mode
- Restore the board
- Restore the correct player turn
- Recalculate win or draw status
- Keep the move history accurate
- Undo should be disabled when there are no moves to undo.
## Undo Behavior by Mode
- In **Two Player Mode**, Undo should remove only the most recent move.
- Example:
- X plays
- O plays
- User clicks Undo
- O’s move is removed
- It is O’s turn again
- In **Computer Mode**, Undo should remove the computer’s last move and the human player’s previous move together.
- Example:
- X plays
- O computer plays
- User clicks Undo
- Both O’s move and the previous X move are removed
- It is X’s turn again

### 3. Scoreboard
- Maintain a session-level scoreboard.
- Track:
- X wins
- O wins
- Draws
- The scoreboard should update when a game is completed.
- The scoreboard should update only once for a completed game.
- Reset Game should keep the scoreboard unchanged.
- Provide a separate **Reset Scoreboard** option.
- The scoreboard should be served by the backend.

### 4. Basic Computer Mode
Provide two game modes:
1. **Two Player Mode**
1. **Play Against Computer**
- In **Two Player Mode**, both X and O are controlled by users.
- In **Computer Mode**:
- Human player is X
- Computer player is O
- Computer should make a move automatically after the human move
- Computer should make only valid moves
- Computer should not move after the game is already completed
- The computer move logic should follow this priority:
1. If O can win, play the winning move
1. If X can win next, block X
1. Take center if available
1. Take a corner if available
1. Take any available cell

## Backend Requirements
- The .NET backend should expose REST APIs for game operations.
- The backend should own the game session state, move history, game status, and scoreboard.
## Suggested API Scope
| **Method** | **Endpoint** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /api/games | Create a new game session |
| GET | /api/games/{id} | Get current game state |
| POST | /api/games/{id}/moves | Submit a player move |
| POST | /api/games/{id}/undo | Undo last move |
| POST | /api/games/{id}/reset | Reset the current game |
| GET | /api/scoreboard | Get scoreboard |
| POST | /api/scoreboard/reset | Reset scoreboard |
- The exact endpoint names can vary, but the submitted solution should clearly document the API contract.

## Game State Response
- The backend should return enough information for the frontend to render the game correctly.
- A game state response should include:
- Game ID
- Board state
- Current player
- Game mode
- Game status
- Winner, if any
- Winning cells, if any
- Move history
- Scoreboard or a way to retrieve scoreboard
- Example game statuses:
- InProgress
- Won
- Draw

## Move Request
- When the frontend submits a move, the request should include:
- Game ID
- Player
- Row and column, or cell index
- The backend should validate the move.
- The backend should reject invalid moves such as:
- Move outside the board
- Move on an occupied cell
- Move after game completion
- Move by the wrong player

## Frontend Requirements
- The Angular application should provide a clean and usable interface.
- The UI should show:
- Game board
- Current player
- Selected game mode
- Winner or draw message
- Highlighted winning cells
- Move history
- Scoreboard
- Reset Game button
- Undo Last Move button
- Reset Scoreboard button
- The frontend should call the backend APIs for game actions and render the latest state returned by the backend.
- The UI should be responsive enough to use comfortably on a laptop browser.

## Important Clarifications
## Clarification 1: Backend State Ownership
- The backend should be the source of truth for the current game state.
- The frontend may maintain UI state, but game rules, move validation, game status, move history, and scoreboard should be consistent with the backend response.

## Clarification 2: Scoreboard and Undo
- The scoreboard should remain consistent after game completion.
- Use one of the following approaches and mention the choice in the README:
## Option A: Disable Undo After Completion
- Once a game is won or drawn, Undo is disabled.
- The scoreboard remains final for that game.
## Option B: Allow Undo After Completion
- Undo can be used after a game is completed.
- If the completed result is reversed through Undo, the scoreboard should also be adjusted correctly.

## Testing Expectations
- Include tests for the core game logic.
- At minimum, cover:
- Valid move
- Invalid move
- Turn switching
- Row win
- Column win
- Diagonal win
- Draw
- Reset game
- Undo in two-player mode
- Undo in computer mode
- Scoreboard update
- Computer move selection
- Move after game completion
- Backend unit tests are preferred for game rules and state transitions.
- Frontend tests may cover component rendering and API integration points.

## AI-Assisted Development Expectation
- You may use AI-assisted development tools to build the solution.
- During submission and review, be prepared to explain:
- How you converted the requirement into a specification
- What prompts you used
- What the AI generated
- What you changed manually
- Which parts you reviewed carefully
- What assumptions you made
- What trade-offs you chose
- The final submission should reflect your own understanding and engineering judgment.
